# Chit_Chat_Deploy
Simple chatroom messaging system

Chit Chat is a chat application created by myself and three other William Paterson University students during my tenure there. We used Javascript coupled with HTML and CSS to create this application. NodeJS with package SocketIO was used as the backend to communicate between the client and server. HTML, CSS and Javascript was used for the look and feel of the website. The project was hosted on Heroku, a free cloud service used to ship apps into production.
